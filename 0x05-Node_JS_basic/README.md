## Tasks

### 0. Executing basic javascript with Node JS

In the file`0-console.js`, create a function named `displayMessage` that prints in `STDOUT` the string argument.
```bash
bob@dylan:~$ cat 0-main.js
const displayMessage = require('./0-console');

displayMessage("Hello NodeJS!");

bob@dylan:~$ node 0-main.js
Hello NodeJS!
bob@dylan:~$
```

---

### 1. Using Process stdin
Create a program named `1-stdin.js` that will be executed through command line:
- It should display the message `Welcome to Holberton School, what is your name?` (followed by a new line)
- The user should be able to input their name on a new line
- The program should display `Your name is: INPUT`
- When the user ends the program, it should display `This important software is now closing` (followed by a new line)
**Requirements:**
- Your code will be tested through a child process, make sure you have everything you need for that
```bash
bob@dylan:~$ node 1-stdin.js 
Welcome to Holberton School, what is your name?
Bob
Your name is: Bob
bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ echo "John" | node 1-stdin.js 
Welcome to Holberton School, what is your name?
Your name is: John
This important software is now closing
bob@dylan:~$
```

### 2. Reading a file synchronously with Node JS

Using the database `database.csv` (provided in project description), create a function `countStudents` in the file `2-read_file.js`
- Create a function named `countStudents`. It should accept a path in argument
- The script should attempt to read the database file synchronously
- If the database is not available, it should throw an error with the text `Cannot load the database`
- If the database is available, it should log the following message to the console `Number of students: NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS`
- It should log the number of students in each field, and the list with the following format: `Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES`
- CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!
```bash
bob@dylan:~$ cat 2-main_0.js
const countStudents = require('./2-read_file');

countStudents("nope.csv");

bob@dylan:~$ node 2-main_0.js
2-read_file.js:9
    throw new Error('Cannot load the database');
    ^

Error: Cannot load the database
...
bob@dylan:~$
bob@dylan:~$ cat 2-main_1.js
const countStudents = require('./2-read_file');

countStudents("database.csv");

bob@dylan:~$ node 2-main_1.js
Number of students: 10
Number of students in CS: 6. List: Johann, Arielle, Jonathan, Emmanuel, Guillaume, Katie
Number of students in SWE: 4. List: Guillaume, Joseph, Paul, Tommy
bob@dylan:~$
```

### 3. Reading a file asynchronously with Node JS

Using the database `database.csv` (provided in project description), create a function `countStudents` in the file `3-read_file_async.js`

- Create a function named `countStudents`. It should accept a path in argument (same as in `2-read_file.js`)
- The script should attempt to read the database file asynchronously
- The function should return a Promise
- If the database is not available, it should throw an error with the text `Cannot load the database`
- If the database is available, it should log the following message to the console `Number of students: NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS`
- It should log the number of students in each field, and the list with the following format: `Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES`
- CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!
```bash
bob@dylan:~$ cat 3-main_0.js
const countStudents = require('./3-read_file_async');

countStudents("nope.csv")
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Done!");
    })
        .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });

bob@dylan:~$ node 3-main_0.js
Error: Cannot load the database
...
bob@dylan:~$
bob@dylan:~$ cat 3-main_1.js
const countStudents = require('./3-read_file_async');

countStudents("database.csv")
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Done!");
    })
        .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });
console.log("After!");

bob@dylan:~$ node 3-main_1.js
After!
Number of students: 10
Number of students in CS: 6. List: Johann, Arielle, Jonathan, Emmanuel, Guillaume, Katie
Number of students in SWE: 4. List: Guillaume, Joseph, Paul, Tommy
Done!
bob@dylan:~$
```
**Tips:**
- Using asynchronous callbacks is the preferred way to write code in Node to avoid blocking threads.

### 4. Create a small HTTP server using Node's HTTP module

In a file named `4-http.js`, create a small HTTP server using the http module:
- It should be assigned to the variable `app` and this one must be exported
- HTTP server should listen on port 1245
- Displays `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body for any endpoint as plain text

In terminal 1:
```bash
bob@dylan:~$ node 4-http.js
...
```

In terminal 2:
```bash
bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245 && echo ""
Hello Holberton School!
bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/any_endpoint && echo ""
Hello Holberton School!
bob@dylan:~$
```

---

### 5. Create a more complex HTTP server using Node's HTTP module

In a file named `5-http.js`, create a small HTTP server using the `http` module:
- It should be assigned to the variable `app` and this one must be exported
- HTTP server should listen on port 1245
- It should return plain text
- When the URL path is `/`, it should display `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body
- When the URL path is `/students`, it should display `This is the list of our students` followed by the same content as the file `3-read_file_async.js` (with and without the database) - the name of the database must be passed as argument of the file
- CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!
```bash
Terminal 1:

bob@dylan:~$ node 5-http.js database.csv
...
```
```bash
In terminal 2:

bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245 && echo ""
Hello Holberton School!
bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/students && echo ""
This is the list of our students
Number of students: 10
Number of students in CS: 6. List: Johann, Arielle, Jonathan, Emmanuel, Guillaume, Katie
Number of students in SWE: 4. List: Guillaume, Joseph, Paul, Tommy
bob@dylan:~$
```

### 6. Create a small HTTP server using Express

Install Express and in a file named 6-http_express.js, create a small HTTP server using Express module:
- It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
- HTTP server should listen on port 1245
- Displays Hello Holberton School! in the page body for the endpoint /

In terminal 1:
```bash
bob@dylan:~$ node 6-http_express.js
...
```

In terminal 2:
```bash
bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245 && echo ""
Hello Holberton School!
bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/any_endpoint && echo ""
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Cannot GET /lskdlskd</pre>
</body>
</html> 
bob@dylan:~$ 
```

### 7. Create a more complex HTTP server using Express
In a file named `7-http_express.js`, recreate the small HTTP server using Express:

- HTTP server should listen on port 1245
- It should return plain text
- When the URL path is `/`, it should display `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body
